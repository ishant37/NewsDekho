# 🚀 Vercel Deployment Guide for NewsDekho

## Problem Solved ✅

Your app wasn't showing on Vercel because:
1. **Missing SPA routing configuration** - Vercel didn't know how to handle React Router routes
2. **Environment variables not set** - API key wasn't configured on Vercel
3. **Missing build configuration** - Needed proper Vite build settings

## Files Added/Modified

- ✅ `vercel.json` - Routes all requests to index.html (SPA support)
- ✅ `vite.config.js` - Added proper build configuration
- ✅ `.env.example` - Template for environment variables
- ✅ `.env.local` - Your local API key (DO NOT commit this!)

## 📝 Deployment Steps

### Step 1: Set Environment Variables on Vercel

**IMPORTANT:** You must add your API key to Vercel's environment variables.

1. Go to your Vercel dashboard: https://vercel.com/dashboard
2. Select your project: `news-dekho-blush`
3. Go to **Settings** → **Environment Variables**
4. Add the following variable:
   - **Key:** `VITE_NEWS_API_KEY`
   - **Value:** `16a838815bd848ed828b976340735419` (your API key)
   - **Environment:** Select all (Production, Preview, Development)
5. Click **Save**

### Step 2: Redeploy Your App

After adding the environment variable:

**Option A: From GitHub**
1. Push your latest code to GitHub:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Fix Vercel deployment with proper routing and config"
   git push origin main
   ```
2. Vercel will automatically redeploy

**Option B: Manual Redeploy**
1. Go to your project on Vercel
2. Go to **Deployments** tab
3. Click the three dots (**⋯**) on the latest deployment
4. Click **Redeploy**

### Step 3: Verify Deployment

Once deployed, your app should work at:
- **Production URL:** https://news-dekho-blush.vercel.app/

Test all routes:
- Home: https://news-dekho-blush.vercel.app/
- Entertainment: https://news-dekho-blush.vercel.app/entertainment
- Sports: https://news-dekho-blush.vercel.app/sports
- Technology: https://news-dekho-blush.vercel.app/technology

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### If the page is still blank:

1. **Check Browser Console:**
   - Open DevTools (F12)
   - Look for errors in the Console tab
   - Common issues: API key errors, CORS errors

2. **Check Vercel Logs:**
   - Go to your project on Vercel
   - Click on the deployment
   - View the **Runtime Logs** and **Build Logs**

3. **Verify Environment Variable:**
   - Make sure `VITE_NEWS_API_KEY` is set correctly
   - Remember: Vite environment variables MUST start with `VITE_`

4. **Check API Key:**
   - Visit: https://newsapi.org/
   - Verify your API key is active
   - Check if you've exceeded the free tier limits

### If routes don't work (404 errors):

- Make sure `vercel.json` exists in your project root
- The file should contain the SPA routing configuration

### Build fails on Vercel:

- Check that all dependencies are in `package.json`
- Verify the build command is: `vite build`
- Check build logs for specific errors

## 📱 Local Development

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install
