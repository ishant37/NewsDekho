## Current Situation
❌ **Error Message:** "There was an error fetching the news. Please try again later."  
❌ **Live Site:** https://news-dekho-blush.vercel.app/ (not working)

## Why This Happens
Your app is deployed successfully, but it can't fetch news because the **API key is missing** from Vercel's environment variables.

## 📞 COMMON MISTAKES

❌ **Wrong key name:** Must be exactly `VITE_NEWS_API_KEY` (not `NEWS_API_KEY` or `API_KEY`)  
❌ **Forgot to redeploy:** Environment variables only apply to NEW deployments  
❌ **Browser cache:** Old error might be cached, do hard refresh  
❌ **Didn't check Production:** Make sure "Production" environment is checked  
❌ **Extra spaces:** Make sure there are no spaces in the value  

---

## 🎉 AFTER SUCCESS

Once working, you can:
- ✅ Browse general news on homepage
- ✅ Check entertainment news at `/entertainment`
- ✅ View sports news at `/sports`
- ✅ Read technology news at `/technology`
- ✅ Navigate with Previous/Next buttons

---

## 💡 REMEMBER

- Environment variables are **NOT** committed to Git
- They must be set **on Vercel dashboard** for production
- You need to **redeploy** after setting them
- The key name **MUST** start with `VITE_` for Vite apps

**Follow these steps exactly and your app WILL work! 🚀**
